File Renamer (FileNameChanger)
-------------
A tool to batch edit file names and extensions.


How to use:
-------------
1. Choose the directory where you want to batch edit files. 
Note: The program only changes the files at the same level of the directory selected and does not change the contents of folders within the directory selected

2. Choose a keyword.
The keyword is a phrase that all the files intended to be changed have in common. A file or folder that does not contain this phrase remains unaffected.

3. Choose a cutoff value.
A cutoff value is a positive number that represents the number of characters to cutoff from the end of the file name. Cutoff count can be 0 if providing an extension. Do NOT include the extension length in your cutoff count.

4. Optional: Choose a universal file extension.
Leave this field blank to maintain the file's original extension. By providing a common file extension, all files are effectively changed to that file type with the new extension. This is helpful for batch changing file types (like .mp4 to .mkv). Note: you must provide a dot when entering an extension to properly change the file. (ex: '.jpeg')

(Press ‘enter’ whenever having typed something into a text field to ensure that it is confirmed.)


Special notes
-------------
- Open the log after selecting a directory to easily see the directory contents. 
- Highlight text in the log and press 'ok' for easy character counting.
- The 'show hidden files' feature is experimental.
